--[[- A store of all items in the system.

@{Items} is the core of Artist's inventory management capabilities. It attempts
to provide an efficient interface to list and move items to and from an internal
set of inventories. It abstracts away the complexities of this, providing four
methods:

 - @{Items:load_peripheral}/@{Items:unload_peripheral}: These add or remove
   a peripheral from the set of inventories items "inside" the system.
 - @{Items:extract}/@{Items:insert}: These move items out of or into the system.

All of these methods may be called from any thread. They're non-blocking,
scheduling work in the peripheral pool and returning immediately.

## Technical details
:::info
This section describes the internal behaviour of this class, and tries to
describe some of the complexities in the design. You don't need to care if you
just want to use it!
:::

There's several complexities involved when interacting with inventories,
especially when doing so in parallel:

 - Peripheral calls are inherently racey. Peripherals may get detached at any
   point, meaning any call may return @{nil} (while we will receive a `peripheral_detach`
   event, it may still be buried deep in the event queue).

 - Similarly racey is the contents of inventories themselves. `.list()` or
   `.getItemDetails()` are not guaranteed to be correct _by the time we receive
   the results_. It's possible an item has been moved in a chest by a player,
   hopper, or other peripheral call.

   This is not a problem for inventories managed by @{Items} - we assume that
   only Artist touches them. However, it is a problem assume for external
   inventories - it's not safe to call `.list()` and then @{Items:insert} and
   assume the hash is the same.

 - This is compounded when making peripheral calls in parallel. Say we have 64
   items in a chest, and we naively try to extract it twice. One call will
   succeed (moving 64 items) and another will fail (moving 0).

   Thankfully this is not as bad as it could be. If inventory methods yield,
   they will execute and queue events in the same order as they were called.
   This means we do not need to worry about calling `list()` (and updating
   the our cache of the inventory) and `pushItems()` (which would decrement the
   count of a slot in the cache) at the same time.

   :::note
   On CC:T we have a per-computer ordering, as main-thread tasks are stored in a
   per-computer queue. We are more relaxed here, only requiring ordering on a
   per-peripheral basis.

:::

### Technical details
Some care is taken in the worker function (`load_peripheral_internal`) to handle
various edge cases:

 - Peripherals may be detached, meaning `.list()` or `.size()` returns `nil`.
 - A peripheral may be unloaded (and optionally loaded) again, meaning the
   inventory registered in `self.registries[name]` is not equal to the one our
   instance is currently loading - in this case we need to abort.

The second bullet is especially important as we always want a sequence of
@{Items:load_peripheral} and @{Items:unload_peripheral} to correctly load/unload
peripherals, irregardless of what stage of loading they're in.

@tparam Items self The current items instance.
@tparam string name The peripheral to load.

:::caution
This does not cancel any ongoing insertions and extractions (as we cannot abort
ongoing `pushItems`/`pullItems` peripheral calls). As such, this should only
be called when a peripheral is detached (where the peripheral calls will fail
anyway) or if no transfer tasks are running.

Unmounting while a transfer is ongoing should not break any invariants in the

--[[- Extract items from the system, moving them into another inventory.

:::info
If a transfer fails (for instance, due to inventories being detached), the
transfer will not be re-attempted.
:::

### Technical details
This looks up the item within our internal cache and then finds all slots
the item exists in.

For each slot, we attempt to reserve as many items as possible (bounded by
the number of items in the slot, the number of already reserved items for this slot
and the number of items we've got left to transfer).

Assuming we've space left in the target inventory, this guarantees we can transfer
this number of items to the target. As such, we then spawn a job to transfer this
number of items. If we need to transfer more items, we continue searching through
other slots.

Spawning a job for each slot allows us to do the actual transfer in parallel,
allowing moving dozens of stacks in a single tick.

Once all jobs are done, we invoke the `done` callback.

#### Edge cases
 - As always, the peripheral call may fail.
 - An inventory may have been detached either by the time the job gets to run
   or by the time the `pushItems()` call has failed.

   More awkward is a peripheral being unloaded and loaded while the call is
   ongoing, as items will be transferred but inventory may change without us
   updating counts. In practice I don't think this will occur in-game.

@tparam Items self The current items instance.
@tparam string to The inventory to push to.
@tparam string hash The hash of the item we're pushing.

### Technical details
Unlike extraction, we don't attempt to pull items in parallel. In fact, as we
don't know _for sure_ what item we're pulling, we can't even be especially smart
about it.

Instead what we do is attempt to pull into any slot in an inventory (prioritising
inventories which match the probably hash). Afterwards we schedule another task
to rescan the inventory.

When running multiple inserts in parallel, we want to avoid having to do rescan
the same chest multiple times. To do that, we increment a "modification sequence"
counter on the inventory just before calling `.pullItems(...)`. Once the call
has completed, if the inventory was not scanned since the _latest_ modification
sequence, we schedule a new scan and update the "scanned at" variable.

While the other `.pullItems(...)` calls may not have completed yet, `.list(...)`
appears after them in the peripheral queue, and so will pick up all changes in
this batch.

@tparam Items self The current items instance.
@tparam string from The inventory to pull from.
@tparam string from_slot The slot to pull from.
@tparam { name = string, count = number, nbt? = string }|number item The item we're
pulling. This should either be a slot from `list()` or `getItemDetails()`, or
